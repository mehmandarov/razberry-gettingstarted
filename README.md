Example code for using [Razberry](http://razberry.z-wave.me/) to control Z-Wave devices for building IoT solutions.

## API
*All requests* listed below require basic authentication. Without autentification parameters you will be presented with HTTP error code ```401 Unauthorized```. For more information, see [authentication](#authentication) sub-chapter on this page.

### Authentication
For sending HTTP requests with authentication it is advisable to use command line tools like ```curl```, or tools like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) (or similar). This will simplify the the process of authentication, request development and testing, as well as handling the JSON responses from those requests.

It is also possible to use simple authentication to perform the requests with no extra authentication request. However, keep in mind that embedding authentication information into URL might have been disabled or depricated in your browser. Example of such request:

```
http://{username}:{password}@{ip}:8083/{anyurl}
```

### List devices
To see all the connected devices use the following URL:
```
http://{ip}:8083/ZAutomation/api/v1/devices
```

### Commands
To send a command to a particular device use the following URL:
```
http://{ip}:8083/ZAutomation/api/v1/devices/ZWayVDev_zway_{ID}/command/on
```

ID is the full identifier, e.g. ZwayVDev_zway_2-0-48-1 â€“ dash [-] separated _node_, _instance_, _command class_, and _scale_.

Example:
```
http://{ip}:8083/ZAutomation/api/v1/devices/ZWayVDev_zway_2-0-37
http://{ip}:8083/ZAutomation/api/v1/devices/ZWayVDev_zway_2-0-37/command/on
```

### Get information from a device
#### High level API
Provides you with basic information about a device:
```
http://{ip}:8083/ZAutomation/api/v1/devices/ZWayVDev_zway_2-0-49-4
```

#### Low level API
For getting and, especially, setting values you can use the low level API. Device number, instance, command class and other paramters used in the request below can be extracted from the _device ID_ described in the [commands](#commands) sub-chapter.

Get a particular value:
```
http://{ip}:8083/ZWaveAPI/Run/devices[2].instances[0].commandClasses[49].data[4].val.value
```
Set a particular value:
```
http://{ip}:8083/ZWaveAPI/Run/devices[2].instances[0].commandClasses[37].Set(255)
```
